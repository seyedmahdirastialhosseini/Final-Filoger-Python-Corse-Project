# Final Project: OOP-based Backend System for School Management

## Description
This project is designed to create an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) backend system for managing school operations. It focuses on entities such as **students**, **teachers**, **classes**, and **courses**. The system supports operations like:
- Adding, removing, editing, and searching records.
- Generating insightful reports.

The project is structured into four main parts:
1. **Object-Oriented Database Design**
2. **CRUD Operations with OOP**
3. **Visualization and Reporting**
4. **System Logging**

## Features
- **Database Design**: Develop a schema using OOP principles.
- **CRUD Operations**: Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionalities for all entities.
- **Reporting**: Generate and visualize reports to provide insights.
- **Logging**: Track system operations for debugging and analysis.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Object-Oriented Programming)
- Database (SQLite/MySQL/PostgreSQL, or any other)
- Visualization Tools (Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.)
- Logging Module in Python

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
